# Movie Recommendation System

This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies based on collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. The system is implemented using Python and Streamlit, and it provides visualizations to enhance user experience.

## Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends movies based on user interaction data.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on cosine similarity of movie tags.
- **Hybrid Recommendation**: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering to provide better recommendations.
- **Visualization**: Interactive charts and graphs to visualize recommendations using Streamlit.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WsUhSHgrMBzjfrLeQDKrf_Br0CXLQXam?usp=sharing).

## Project Structure

- **app.py**: The main application script for the Streamlit app.
- **recommendation_model.py**: Contains the logic for generating recommendations.
- **requirements.txt**: A list of Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
    cd yourrepository
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Download the dataset**:

   Download the dataset from the [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WsUhSHgrMBzjfrLeQDKrf_Br0CXLQXam?usp=sharing) and place it in the appropriate directory.

4. **Run the Streamlit app**:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Usage

Once the app is running, you can:
- **Search for a movie** and get recommendations based on collaborative filtering or content-based filtering.
- **View visualizations** of the similarity scores and recommended movies.
- **Explore the hybrid recommendation system** that combines both filtering methods.

## Additional Features

- **User Feedback Mechanism**: You can implement a feedback mechanism to allow users to rate the recommendations, improving the model's accuracy over time.
- **Personalized Dashboard**: Users can have a personalized recommendation dashboard that tracks their preferences and history.
- **Enhanced Visualization**: Explore more visualization options like pie charts, histograms, or interactive plots to provide better insights.
